\title{Continue to extract soil parameters using pedotransfer functions}

\description{
Function to continue the extraction of soil parameters started with SoilParams at the tile where the process stopped.}

\usage{SoilParamsCont(catch, DEM, c=1000)}

\arguments{
\item{catch} shapefile of the catchment/study area, different projections are accepted. Read the shapefile with readOGR().
\item{DEM} digital elevation model of the study area (raster), different projections are accepted, using gcs WGS1984 longlat may save some time. Read the raster file with raster().
\item{c} maximum number of cells in x and y direction for single tiles, default is set to 1000}

\value{

\item{last_tile}{Indicates which was the last treated tile, allowing to continue a not-finished run from this tile with SoilParamsCont}
\item{soil_sum_recent}{Shows the results of the last calculated tile}
\item{soil_sum_collected}{Results of all treated tiles together}
\item{soil_sum_weighted}{The final result of all tiles: mean values for each soil_id, weighted due to the number of occurrence}
\item{Mapsoils/soils_catchment.tif}{Map with the new soil ids, to ids with alluvium 1000 was added}

Input tables for WASA:
\item{particle_classes}{Definition of particle classes}
\item{r_soil_contains_particles}{Fraction of each particle class for each soil_id, only topsoil is considered}
\item{horizons}{Describes each horizon of each soil_id}
\item{soils}{Bedrock, alluvium and organic matter content for each soil_id}
